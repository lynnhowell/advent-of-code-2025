How it works:

For each bank (line of digits), the script checks all possible pairs of distinct positions, concatenates the digits, and tracks the largest possible value.
It sums the largest value from each bank and prints the total.
Usage:
Place this script in the same repo as your day3/day3part1.txt input file and run:

bash
python day3part1.py
It will output your solution.
